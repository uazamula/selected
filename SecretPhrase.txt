No money no honey
No man is an island
If you wish to be loved, love!
World belongs to the patient
Everyone is the creator of one's own fate
Tolerance is more powerful than force
Truth is more of a stranger than fiction
Don't let your mind kill your heart and soul
Respect the past, create the future
Success doesn't come to you...you go to it
Love is the movement
Failure does not mean i'm a failure; It does mean I have not yet succeeded
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest
The only thing in life achieved without effort is failure
Success is the child of audacity
Always forgive your enemies; nothing annoys them so much
